#  Kyma Showcase Application Working Group

The purpose of this Working Group (WG) is to build a Unified Demo Project with a consistent story to showcase the complete functionality and features of Kyma. This application should be complex enough to showcase advance features, but can also be dumbed down to showcase only basic and simple functionalities that can be used in a Getting Started guide, for example.

## Goals
- Build an application complex enough to showcase the full functionality of Kyma (see [issue #506 containing the proposal](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/issues/506) and the [GoogleCloudPlatform example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) for reference).
- Split the application into functional components (microservices, micro frontends, serverless functions) that can be reused and shared across tutorials.
- Discover and bring to the surface missing features or improvements that are needed to offer the best development experience possible with Kyma.
- Document the development process and the learnings using blog posts, Youtube videos, live coding sessions, etc. to expand our social media coverage.
- Use new technologies (focus on buzzwords) to have a greater chance of getting viral and create waves in the social network space. Those new technologies (AI, Machine Learning) can also reveal some of the future-proofing necessary for Kyma to be competitive in a broader technology spectrum space.
- Align existing example repositories to a unified story:
    - https://github.com/kyma-incubator/examples
    - https://github.com/kyma-project/examples
    - https://github.com/SAP-samples/kyma-runtime-extension-samples
    - Getting Started guide
