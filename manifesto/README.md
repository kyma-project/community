# Kyma Elevator Pitch

Kyma is a cloud-native application runtime that gives you the power of Kubernetes but without the hassle of worrying about security, configuration, and integration of tools. 
Kyma does it for you, as it not only combines various components needed for cloud-native development but also fills the gaps between these components to make them work smoothly together and let you focus on your work.
With Kyma, you can extend applications using your technology of choice! 
All you need to do is install and set up Kyma and you’re good to go, with a ready-to-use cluster, and a Console UI, too!

The batteries-included approach eliminates the steep learning curve that comes with Kubernetes.
It also makes building and running of microservices and serverless functions easier, and service consumption with this approach is just a piece of cake. 
That's because we handpick the essential tools from the huge CNCF landscape, glue them together adding whatever’s needed to make them play smoothly with each other, ensure security, top it off with a UI, and wrap it up nicely for you as Kyma so you can jump straight to developing applications.
