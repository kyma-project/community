# Objects Store

Created on 2019-01-03 by Lukasz Gornicki (@derberg).

## Status

Proposed on 2019-01-04

## Motivation

1. Have a generic solution for storing in s3 like storage any kind of object: zip file, markdown file, PNG or JS (JavaScript)
2. Have a storage solution not locked to one vendor, like AWS S3 only, or like to Minio on-premise only
3. Have a storage solution that not only stores the file but also exposes it directly to internet
