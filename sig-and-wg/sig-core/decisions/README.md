# Decision Records

## Overview

This directory contains records of decisions made by the SIG Core and the Kyma project members.

A decision record (DR) is a short document containing a record of a significant decision made by a Special Interest Group (SIG) or a Working Groups (WG) that affects the project, including its structure, functionalities, components, or work of the project teams. A DR provides, apart from the decision itself, the context and consequences of implementing the discussed solution.

Find the template and guidelines for writing DR documents [here](../../../guidelines/templates/resources/DR.md).
