<!-- above metadata will be used on kyma.project.io page to display nice name of capability and have a reference to label that should be used while fetching from ZenHub/GitHub the information about related Epics and their delivery plan   -->

## Goal

This is one paragraph that explain what is the goal of the capability. Short paragraph explanation what is the purpose of the capability.

## Vision

* For best experience 
* It is a bulleted list of elements
* That create a vision

But it can also be a text if bullet points do not make sense. It can also be a combination of both. Just keep in mind to limit yourself to vision only. This is not a place for specific proposals explanations of features descriptions. This is what Epics are for. Epic if based on proposal, should have proper proposal references.
