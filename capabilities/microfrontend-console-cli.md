## Scope

The Microfrontends/Console/CLI capability is all about how a user interacts with kyma. It drives the development of Console, a modular and extensible web user interface for managing all aspects of kyma, and ensures all kyma functionality can also be accessed from a command line interface.

## Vision

- Provide easy and intuitive user interfaces for kyma to support its users in the best possible way
- Focus on a consistent user experience
- Don't hide the kubernetes nature from the user but augment it with kyma-specific user guidance
- Have a technology agnostic UI extension mechanism to ease customization
- Provide theming support to ease UI integration in other applications or suites
- Extract web UI modularity and extensibility functionality and provide it as a standalone framework
- Treat CLI as a first class citizen
- Replace all OS-specific scripts by CLI commands to ensure portability
- Ensure consistent and correct usage of UI components and styles, API access and microfrontend-hosting
