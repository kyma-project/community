<!-- The metadata is used on the "https://kyma-project.io/ " page to display a descriptive name of the capability and have a reference to the label that should be used while fetching information about related Epics and their delivery plan from ZenHub and GitHub.   -->

## Scope

Include a one-paragraph explanation of the capability's purpose and scope.

## Vision

* For best experience 
* It is a bulleted list of elements
* That create a vision

It can also be a text if bullet points do not make sense. It can also be a combination of both. Just keep in mind that you should limit yourself to the vision. This is not a place for specific proposals explanations or features descriptions. This is what Epics are for. An Epic is based on a proposal and should have proper proposal references.
