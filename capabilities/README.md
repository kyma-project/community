# Capabilities

Kyma consists of a number of different features that enable Kyma to be a ready-to-extend enterprise application in a cloud-native world.
These features are grouped in different areas called **Capabilities**.
This directory contains a description of each capability, its vision, and goal. These are source files rendered on `https://kyma-project.io/` and the **Capabilities** subpage.

This table lists all capabilities and links to their descriptions.
