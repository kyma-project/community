<!-- Thank you for your contribution. Before you submit the issue:
1. Search open and closed issues for duplicates.
2. Read the contributing guidelines.
3. In case of vulnerabilities with a CVSS Base Score of *7.0* or above (see risk assessment section), please send an email directly to security@kyma-project.io instead of using this issue tracker. You can still use this template in your email. You can also use email for vulnerabilities with lower severity, if you prefer to keep your report confidential.

**Description**

<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
Describe where it appears, when it occurred, and what it affects.  -->

<!-- Provide relevant technical details such as the browser name and version, or the operating system. -->

**Steps to reproduce**

<!-- List the steps to follow to reproduce the vulnerability. Attach any files, links, code samples, or screenshots that could help in investigating the problem. -->

**Risk assessment**

<!-- Propose a CVSSv3.0 Base Score for the vulnerability.
Please use the CVSS calculator at https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0 and fill in the risk metrics for the CVSS Base Score. Then replace the placeholders in the following template: -->
[{CVSS Base Vector}]({CVSS Calculator URL}) **{CVSS Base Score} ({CVSS Base Severity})**
<!--
For example:
[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N) **7.1 (High)**

Placeholder details:
* {CVSS Base Vector}: 
  String representation of the CVSS metrics, as displayed the CVSS calculator. 
  For example: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
* {CVSS Calculator URL}:
  A deeplink to the CVSS calculator with the metrics that you propose. 
  Automatically appears in your browser's URL bar after you filled in the metrics.
  Contains the {CVSS Base Vector}.
  For example: https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
* {CVSS Base Score}:
  The numeric risk score determined by the CVSS calculator.
  Appears prominently in the upper right corner of the base score area. Ranges from 0 to 10.
  For example: 7.1
* {CVSS Base Severity}:
  A textual classification of the {CVSS Base Score}.
  Appears right underneath the {CVSS Base Score} in the calculator.
  Possible values are "None", "Low", "Medium", "High", and "Critical".
  For example: High

<!-- Feel free to leave a brief note here that explains the CVSS metrics that you chose. In particular those where you chose any value but the left-most one in the CVSS calculator UI. -->


**Proposed mitigation**

<!-- Optionally, add any suggestions on how you would like to see this vulnerability mitigated. -->
