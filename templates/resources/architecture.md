title: Architecture
---

<!-- Use this template to describe in detail the architecture of a given Kyma area and/or component. This document should include, among others, the diagram that illustrates all components and sub-components involved, a description of the functions they perform, and a step-by-step description of the workflow.

* For the filename, follow the `{COMPONENT/AREA}-{NUMBER}-{TITLE}.md` convention.
* For the title metadata, follow the `{Component name} architecture` convention.

For reference, see the existing [**Architecture** documents](https://kyma-project.io/#/05-technical-reference/00-architecture/README).-->

## Architecture Diagram

<!--  Provide a [diagram](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/docs/guidelines/content-guidelines/09-diagrams.md) which illustrates the workflow of a given component. The diagram is a **mandatory** element of this document. -->

## {Architecture/workflow description}

<!-- Describe all components and sub-components involved in the workflow together with their functions.

- To describe a step-by-step workflow, use an ordered list.
- If the document does not describe any workflow but the overall arrangement of the components and sub-components, use sections. In this case, describe each component in a separate section. Use H2 (##) for sections and H3 (###) for sub-sections. Do not use headings smaller than H3 as they do not display well on the UI. -->
