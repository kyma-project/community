# Overview
# OWNERS is the Prow feature that allows you to create an ownership structure across the entire repository.
# This file consists of the list of `approvers` and `reviewers` and `labels`.
#
# The basic structure goes as follows:
# reviewers:
#   - githubUser1
#   - githubUser2
#   - githubUserN
# approvers:
#   - githubApprover1
#   - githubApprover2
#   - girhubApproverN
# labels: # optional
#   - label1
#   - label2
# Having the same set of reviewers and approvers is considered a bad practice and should be avoided!
#
# For more advanced configuration please refer to the kubernetes documentation linked below.
#
# You can use multiple OWNERS files across entire repository to diversify the ownership between multiple people.
#
# For more information please refer to the Kubernetes documentation regarding OWNERS file as well as the ANNOUNCEMENTS.md file on the kubernetes/test-infra repository.
