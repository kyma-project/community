## Overview

This document defines the maintenance policy for the [Kyma](../../../) organization. All repositories in this organization must follow all the rules and guidelines to assure quality and consistency.

The Kyma project also includes the [Kyma Incubator](https://github.com/kyma-incubator) organization. It is a place where all new projects start in a more relaxed environment that facilitates their rapid growth. At that stage, they do not have to comply with all the rules that govern the Kyma organization. Once the incubating project is ready to become a part of the main Kyma organization, you must adjust it to all the standards.

## Maintenance policy

The Kyma maintainers are a group of people that have special privileges in the repositories of the [GitHub](../../../) organization. The maintainers have the ability to approve pull requests after a detailed review of the code and its functionality. The rules for contributing to Kyma are available in the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

## Maintainers' responsibilities

With great power comes great responsibility. Maintainers not only make changes and approve pull requests but also truly care about their projects.

Every maintainer is expected to:

* contribute high-quality code and content
* communicate and collaborate with other maintainers to improve the maintenance process
* perform a thorough review of incoming pull requests
* approve only those pull requests in which the contributor made the requested improvements
* check if the related CI job has completed successfully before approving the pull request
* make sure that the pull request approval flow runs smoothly
* prioritize issues and manage their processing
* proactively fix bugs
* perform maintenance tasks for their projects

## Become a maintainer

To become a maintainer, contact one of the existing maintainers of the given project and agree to fulfill the requirements listed above.
The existing maintainer can also propose a new member by creating a pull request adding the candidate to the `CODEOWNERS` file in the project's repository. The change requires the two-third majority of all maintainers' votes.

## Remove a maintainer

The maintainer's role requires commitment and ongoing contribution to a project. If a maintainer is no longer able to fulfill these requirements or does not contribute to the project for half a year, remove them from the list. The change requires the two-third majority of all maintainers' votes.
