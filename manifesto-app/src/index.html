            <div class="accordion">
                <p>New components should be thought through and useful from a business perspective. Unnecessary functions should
                    disappear and periodic reviews should be maintained to ensure that Kyma is
                    still on the right track.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Strive to have central, core concepts. For example, labels for event providers. Every concept must have
                        an owner.</li>
                    <li>New product design is not only based on a feel for the industry, but requires extensive research. Product
                        decisions are based on a specific business need using real qualitative and quantitative data received
                        from user testing, and feedback.</li>
                    <li>Don't keep unused features. Based on proper data analytics, identify unused features and evaluate whether
                        you can deprecate them.</li>
                    <li>Perform frequent roadmap reviews and adjustments so as not to fall behind. Don't get stuck in implementations
                        that do not make sense.</li>
                    <li>Every entity must have a defined lifecycle. From the very beginning, there must be a design. For example,
                        the proper removal of data for inactive, or trial and demo users.</li>
                    <li>Documentation is important at every production level, both detailed and more general.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Create more with less. Resource and component efficiency is crucial. Minimize impact on the infrastructure
                        by keeping resource consumption to the minimum when you work toward any goal.</li>
                    <li>Delivering features is easy, but keep in mind the recommended limits on memory usage (not more than 64MB),
                        startup time (not more then 3 seconds), and resource consumption. For example, consider the size
                        of the logs you produce.</li>
                    <li>When choosing technology, consider the cost of the onboarding process, the size of the community behind
                        it, and the adoption rate.</li>
                    <li>Have a fast and reliable deployment pipeline.</li>
                    <li>The whole Kyma cluster must be easy to deploy and easy to remove afterwards. This
                        gives you a good way to handle and test the presentation environment. For example, this lets you
                        test upgrades to the whole environment.</li>
                    <li>Use logical over physical separation. For example, leverage Kubernetes namespaces to separate environments.</li>

                <p>Architecture of the whole Kyma should be flexible enough not to cause bottle necks. So

                <ul>

                        and never split functionalities across teams. Scale teams based on current team members. For example,
                        the setup of the Gopher and Gorilla teams.</li>
                    <li>Strive for event-oriented architecture. Achieve full independence to make it simple to exchange components.

                        depend on external commercial implementations. For example, do not depend on external marketplace
                        implementations; we should write our own.</li>
