title: Kyma Steering Committee
---

The purpose of the Kyma Steering Committee is to:
* Maintaining the mission, vision, values, and scope of the project
* Engage in the resolution of conflicts that cannot be solved by other governance rules
* With help of community, refining the governance model as needed
* Agree to the new SIG or WG proposals or raise concerns about them

## Size of the Committee 

To make sure the committee can always make a majority decision, we have three members. Ultimate goal is to have five members (at least two [individual](/contributing/#contributing-rules-contributing-rules-agreements-and-licenses)), never four.

## Decision making

Whenever the committee is involved and needs to make a decision, decision is always made by majority of votes. In case of three members, it is 2/3 and in case of five it is 3/5.

## Members

[This](https://github.com/orgs/kyma-project/teams/kyma-steering-committee/members) is a GitHub team that lists all current members of the Kyma Steering Committee

* [Ralf Hofmann](https://github.com/ormos) (SAP)
* [Piotr Bochynski](https://github.com/pbochynski) (SAP)
* [Andreas Thaler](https://github.com/a-thaler) (SAP)

We are aware that at the moment Kyma is steered by a single company, SAP. Our goal is to see on the list of members only one SAP representative and four representatives form outside of SAP. We commit that once there are five members on the list and we have another 2 candidates ready to step in, two SAP representatives will step down to achieve truly open governance of the project with five representatives form different parties.

## How to become a member of the committee?

The committee is open for any contributors, [individual or corporate](/contributing/#contributing-rules-contributing-rules-agreements-and-licenses). These are the rules we apply:

* In case of individual contributors, you need to be an active [Kyma maintainer](#kyma-working-model-kyma-working-model-process-for-becoming-a-maintainer-aka-codeowner) for at least 2 major components.
* Single company can have only one employee in the committee. It is up to the company to suggest a candidate that doesn't have to be an active maintainer and he acts as a representative of active maintainers for given company.
* In case one company has one representative in the committee already, and other member starts working for this company, one of the members must resign once there are other candidates to replace him.

Once you fulfill one of the requirements, create a GitHub issue in [community](https://github.com/kyma-project/community) repository and describe:
* Why you want to join the committee
* Who you represent
* What was your current contribution to Kyma
* What components you officially maintain and provide links to all the activities that you took as a maintainer

The members of the committee with openly make comments under the issue. The comment should include information what is the vote and the reasoning for the vote. Candidate will receive clear feedback in case the request is rejected with advice what must be done to improve the request and be accepted.
