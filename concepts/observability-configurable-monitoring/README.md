# Dynamic Monitoring Backend Configuration

This folder contains documents for evaluating and proposing a concept to make the monitoring backends (and general telemetry backends) in a Kyma cluster. The documents mainly try to propose a concept for [configurable monitoring #13079](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/13079).

For that, the following documents guide you through the different steps of the proposal:
* [Groundwork](./01-groundwork.md) - current state, requirements, goal
* [Agents](./02-agents.md) - technology evaluation and selection
* [Proof of Concepts](./03-pocs.md)
* [API Design](./04-api.md)
* [Final Concept](./05-concept.md)
