# Dynamic Trace Backend Configuration

The following documents evaluate and propose a concept for having the tracing backends in a Kyma cluster configurable at runtime ([issue #11236 (configurable tracing)](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/11231).

* [Groundwork](./01-tracing-groundwork.md) - current state, requirements, goal
* [Collectors](./02-tracing-collectors.md) - technology evaluation and selection
* [Proof of Concepts](./03-tracing-pocs.md)
* [API Design](./04-tracing-api.md)
* [Final Concept](./05-tracing-concept.md)
