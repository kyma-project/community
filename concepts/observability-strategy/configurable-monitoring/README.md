# Dynamic Monitoring Backend Configuration

The following documents evaluate and propose a concept to make the monitoring backends in a Kyma cluster configurable at runtime ([issue #13079 (configurable monitoring)](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/13079)).

* [Groundwork](./01-monitoring-groundwork.md) - current state, requirements, goal
* [Agents](./02-monitoring-agents.md) - technology evaluation and selection
* [Proof of Concepts](./03-monitoring-pocs.md)
* [API Design](./04-monitoring-api.md)
* [Final Concept](./05-monitoring-concept.md)
