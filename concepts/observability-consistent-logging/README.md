# Consistent Logging

This folder contains several proposals on how to make the logging of Kyma components more consistent.

- Log format and semantics [proposal](improvement-of-log-messages-usability.md)
- Log library and output channel [proposal](logs-stream-destination-and-library-recomendation.md)
- Log levels [proposal](unified-approach-to-logging-levels.md)
