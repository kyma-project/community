This document describes how to create a Kyma CLI release.

## Release content

A Kyma CLI release consists of:

* GitHub release with automated changelog generation
* Artifacts, including `cli` binaries and source code archives
* A release tag or branch holding the code

## Steps

1. Make sure Kyma is released and create a release branch in the `cli` repository. The name of this branch should follow the `release-x.y` pattern, such as `release-1.4`.

   >**NOTE:** This step applies only to new major and minor versions.

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b {RELEASE_NAME} upstream/master
   git push upstream {RELEASE_NAME}
   ```

2. Ensure that the `KYMA_VERSION` variables in the `Makefile` and `.goreleaser.yml` files from the `cli` repository on the release branch contain the latest Kyma version.

3. Create a PR to `cli/release-x.y` which triggers the presubmit job for `cli`.

4. After merging the PR, create a tag on the release branch that has the same version name as Kyma. If you define a release candidate version, a pre-release is created.  

   ```bash
   git tag -a {RELEASE_VERSION} -m "Release {RELEASE_VERSION}"
   git push upstream {RELEASE_VERSION}
   ```

    where {RELEASE_VERSION} could be `1.4.0-rc1`, `1.4.0-rc2` or `1.4.0`.

5. Push the tag to trigger a postsubmit job that creates the GitHub release. Validate if the release is available under [releases](https://github.com/kyma-project/cli/releases).

6. Once the release is complete, remove the existing `stable` tag and re-create it pointing to the latest commit on the `master` branch. Pushing this tag will trigger a postsubmit job that builds and pushes the latest stable binaries to a storage bucket. These are used by the continuous integration jobs.

7. Update the Homebrew formula of the CLI to the just-released version by following this [guide](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request.md). For a sample Homebrew Kyma CLI formula version bump see the information in [this](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/52375) PR.
