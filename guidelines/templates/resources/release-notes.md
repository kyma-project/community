Place any related screenshots under the [`assets`](https://github.com/kyma-project/website/tree/master/src/blog-posts/assets) folder. Follow the content-related guidelines and tips for writing [release notes](../../content-guidelines/release-notes.md).

> Write an introductory paragraph and present the most important release highlights from all components. List the highlights as bullet points and provide relative links to their corresponding sections.

- [{Feature or fix name}](#relative-link-to-subsection) - {One-sentence description}
- [{Feature or fix name}](#relative-link-to-subsection) - {One-sentence description}
- [{Feature or fix name}](#relative-link-to-subsection) - {One-sentence description}

> [Application Connector modularization](#modularization) - Components have been moved to separate Helm charts.

> Add the <!-- overview --> comment after this introductory paragraph to separate the excerpt rendered on the main page from the rest of the document. For more details, see [these](https://github.com/kyma-project/website/blob/master/docs/write-blog-posts.md) guidelines.
