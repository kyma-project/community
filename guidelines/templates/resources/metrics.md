>This document is a ready-to-use template for the **Metrics** document type that describes service or controller metrics. Follow the `11-{00}-{service/controller-name}.md` convention to name the document.

This table shows the {Service name} custom metrics, their types, and descriptions.

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `{metric_name}` | {metric_type} | {Metric description} |

> If there are some default metrics, such as Prometheus metrics for [Go applications](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/), exposed for the service or controller in addition to the custom ones, add this information to the document. For example, write:

Apart from the custom metrics, the {Service name} also exposes default Prometheus metrics for [Go applications](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/).

> If you describe metrics for a controller that does not expose any custom metrics, write only about the default ones. For example, write:

Metrics for the {Controller name} include:

- {default metric name or description}.
- {another default metric name or description}.
