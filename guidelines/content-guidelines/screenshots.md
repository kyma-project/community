# Screenshots

As someone once said, a picture is worth a thousand words. Therefore, whenever you need to illustrate operations performed on the UI, feel free to use a screenshot to convey a lot of information visually.

Follow these basic principles when placing a screenshot in your content:
- Do not overuse screenshots and limit  visual noise.
- Do not use directional indicators such as "above" and "below" to refer to screenshots. Instead, include a brief introduction before each screenshot that describes its purpose and any necessary details.
- Do not include the mouse pointer in your screenshots, unless it shows a function related to the content.
- Do not include unnecessary elements, such as the browser toolbar. Include only elements that are relevant in a matter of a given content.

For details on how to format screenshots and their elements in the Kyma documents, see the particular document sections.

## Tool

Adjust or capture your screenshots using any tool that outputs high quality images, such as [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html). The desired image format is SVG, but PNG and JPG formats are also acceptable.
Use an online tool such as [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress images and limit the size of each image to 1MB, or smaller.
If you want to control the size of the image relative to the screen size, use one of these standard percentages: 100%, 75%, 50%, or 25%.

> **NOTE:** Name the file as a {screenshot-name} and save it in the `assets` folder in the same location.

## Borders

Use **grey** (HEX: #D2D5D9) 1pt border for the screenshot.

## Steps

If necessary, mark multiple areas or steps on the screenshot using **blue** (HEX: #0A6ED1) round stamps with white numbers.
Explain the steps under the screenshot with the ordered list.

## Indicators

To highlight a certain area of your screenshot, use **red** (HEX: #EF27270) 10pt arrow or box.

> **NOTE:** Use arrows and boxes sparingly, only to point to an exceptionally important area of the screenshot. Do not use more than one indicator in one screenshot to avoid visual noise.
