# Color Panel

The color panel is a feature that allows you to emphasize text block to direct reader's attention. The panel renders as a separate block with colored left border and the color of that border depends on the type of panel.

There are 3 possible types of color panel:
- Note
- Catution
- Tip

<!-- maybe add 3 screenshots here?  -->

Each of those types has distinct border color to signify something different:
- Note, which has blue color, should be used
