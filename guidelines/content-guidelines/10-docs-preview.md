title: Documentation preview
---

Before you publish new documentation on the website, you can preview the changes you made in a pull request to see if the formatting of the text is correct, images fit well, and links work as expected.

That is possible thanks to the **preview feature** supported by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It attaches links to autogenerated previews of the website views to your pull requests.

This feature is enabled on these Kyma repositories:

- [`kyma`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/tree/master/docs) for changes in the `/docs` folder that contains sources of the official Kyma documentation in the [**Docs**](https://kyma-project.io/docs/) view.

- [`community`](https://github.com/kyma-project/community) for changes that show on the [**Community**](https://kyma-project.io/community/) and [**Roadmap**](https://kyma-project.io/roadmap/) views.

- [`website`](https://github.com/kyma-project/website) for changes that show on the main landing page and in the [**Blog**](https://kyma-project.io/blog/) view.

The previews are built for pull requests containing changes made to any files within these repositories. The only exception is the `kyma` repository where we only publish notifications of successful builds on pull requests that modify the content of the `/docs` folder.

## Access previews

After you create a pull request, Netlify attaches a notification to your PR on the build status and a link to:

- a website preview for successful builds

![Successful preview](./assets/successful-preview.png)

>**NOTE:** The preview rebuilds automatically after every commit under the same link.

- a direct link to log details for failed builds

![Failed preview](./assets/failed-preview.png)

The website preview deployment is also visible on the list of jobs that need to pass for the pull request to be merged. Click on **Details** to go to the build logs.

>**NOTE:** For the `kyma` repository, Netlify only attaches notifications for successful preview builds. This, if you make any changes in the `docs` folder and there is no website preview attached to your pull request, access failed build information through **Details** of the **netlify/kyma-project/deploy-preview** job on the job list.
