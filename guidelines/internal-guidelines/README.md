## Overview

This folder contains internal guidelines for the contributors that are members of the Kyma organization.

Internal guidelines include:

- The [`repository-template`](./repository-template/template) folder that provides the structure of the exemplary Kyma repository. Use it whenever you create a new repository within Kyma.
- The [instruction](./new-repository-settings.md) that lists recommended settings for a new repository in the `kyma-project` and `kyma-incubator` organizations.

>**NOTE:** Update this document each time you add a new guideline to the `internal-guidelines` folder.
