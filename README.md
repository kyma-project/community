## Contribution Rules

Before you start contributing, read our [Code of Conduct](docs/contributing/01-code-of-conduct.md) and learn about our [working model](docs/governance/01-governance.md) to understand the way Kyma community works. Get familiar with the [contributing rules](docs/contributing/02-contributing.md), recommended [Git workflow](docs/contributing/03-git-workflow.md), and [issues workflow](docs/governance/03-issues-workflow.md) we use in Kyma so you can apply them later in practice as an active contributor.

## Guidelines

Follow guidelines for writing [content](docs/guidelines/content-guidelines) and [code](docs/guidelines/technical-guidelines). See how to create a [new repository](docs/guidelines/repository-guidelines), read about our [release process](docs/guidelines/releases-guidelines), and use [templates](docs/guidelines/templates/templates-type.md) for various document types.

## Issues

Create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kyma-project) to report a bug or request a feature. Go to the given repository's issue tracker and raise an issue using one of the available templates. The owners of the repository will review your issue and provide you with their feedback. If you are not certain which repository your issue refers to, open it in the [`kyma`](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma) repository. For more information on how issues are handled within the Kyma organization, read about the [issues workflow](docs/governance/03-issues-workflow.md).

## Special Interest Groups & Working Groups

The Kyma community collaborates through Special Interest Groups and Working Groups ([SIGs and WGs](docs/contributing/04-sig-and-wg.md)). By joining the SIGs and WGs, you can meet other community members, exchange information on Kyma, provide feedback, raise interest, ask questions, and learn about the product. Join the SIGs or WGs meeting to learn more what each group works on.
