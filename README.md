# Kyma Community

Welcome to the Kyma community. Here you can find information on how to join the community, get involved, and improve Kyma code and documentation.

Before you proceed, review the [Code of Conduct](./docs/contributing/01-code-of-conduct.md) and contact us on [Slack](http://slack.kyma-project.io/) for any questions or concerns.

## Product information

To get a general idea of what Kyma is and what it does, read [Kyma elevator pitch](manifesto/README.md). Read about the [Kyma personas](manifesto/personas.md) to learn what types of users might be most interested in Kyma. To learn more about the product, visit the [Kyma website](https://kyma-project.io/) or its sources kept in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/main/README.md).

Kyma is also on social media. Follow Kyma on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kyma-project/) to keep updated.

## Contribution

We are an open-source community and the number of contributors is growing. Meet the [Kyma team members](https://github.com/orgs/kyma-project/people) who are the regular contributors and the Kyma founders.

### Process

Before you start to contribute, review the [contribution rules](./docs/contributing/02-contributing.md). To understand better the way the Kyma community works, read about the [working model](./docs/governance/01-governance.md) and learn about the [Special Interest Groups and Working Groups](./collaboration/01-sig-and-wg.md) in Kyma.

All contributors follow the recommended [Git workflow](./docs/contributing/03-git-workflow.md) that relies on forks, branches, rebasing, and squashing. Review it to ensure that you contribute high-quality code and content to the project.

### Issues

To request a feature or report a bug, go to the given repository's issue tracker and raise an issue using one of the available templates. The owners of the repository will review your issue and provide you with their feedback. If you are not certain which repository your issue refers to, open it in the `kyma` repository.

## Guidelines and templates

You can also find these guidelines and templates in the `community` repository:

- [Content guidelines](./docs/guidelines/content-guidelines) that include the overview of the [content strategy](./docs/guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy.md) and the general guidelines on how to write and format documentation and graphics.
- [Release guidelines](./docs/guidelines/releases-guidelines) that contain the details regarding Kyma releases
- [Repository guidelines](./docs/guidelines/repository-guidelines) that contain folder, file, and document structure required for a [skeleton Kyma repository](./templates/repository-template)
- [Technical guidelines](./docs/guidelines/technical-guidelines/) that contain coding standards used in the Kyma project
- Document [templates](./templates/resources) for different document types that are used in Kyma

## Security

The community is relentless about Kyma security. To report a security issue, send an email with details directly to [kyma-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:kyma-security@googlegroups.com) instead of using a public issue tracker.
