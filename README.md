## Product information

Kyma is a cloud-native application runtime which allows you to connect and extend products in a quick and modern way, using serverless computing and microservice architecture. To get a better idea of what Kyma is and what it does, go [here](manifesto/README.md). To learn what types of users might be most interested in Kyma, see the [Kyma personas](manifesto/personas.md).

To learn more about the product, see the [Kyma repository](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/blob/master/README.md).

Kyma is also on social media. Visit the [website](https://kyma-project.io/) and follow Kyma on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kymaproject), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kyma-project/).

## Contribution

We are an open-source community and the number of contributors is growing. Meet the [Kyma team members](https://github.com/orgs/kyma-project/people) who are the regular contributors and the Kyma founders.

### Process

Before you start to contribute, review the [contribution rules](./contributing/02-contributing.md). To understand better the way the Kyma community works, read about the [working model](./governance/01-governance.md) and learn about the [Special Interest Groups and Working Groups](./collaboration/01-sig-and-wg.md) in Kyma.

All contributors follow the recommended [Git workflow](./contributing/03-git-workflow.md) that relies on forks, branches, rebasing, and squashing. Review it to ensure that you contribute high-quality code and content to the project.

### Issues

To request a feature or report a bug, go to the given repository's issue tracker and raise an issue using one of the available templates.
The owners of the repository will review your issue and provide you with their feedback. If you are not certain which repository your issue refers to, open it in the `kyma` repository.

### Collaboration

Feel invited to join the public [Core SIG meetings](https://kyma-community.slack.com/messages/CBP7LKRPS/) where you can contribute to the Kyma development and help us drive it forward. Contact the Kyma team directly on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kyma-community/shared_invite/enQtNDAwNzE4Mjk2NDE3LTJhOTlmZjM5YzkwNmEzNmY3ZjE2MTU2OTMxOGE4ZDM0MmU4ZWRkZGJiODgzNmRmMTYxMDYwNjZiMDAwMTA2OWM) to exchange ideas, ask questions, receive hints and tips, and extend your experience with Kyma.

## Guidelines and templates

You can also find these guidelines and templates in the `community` repository:

- [Naming](./guidelines/technical-guidelines/01-naming.md) conventions
- Document [templates](./guidelines/templates)
- Overview of the [content strategy](./guidelines/content-guidelines/01-content-strategy.md) and [content guidelines](./guidelines/content-guidelines)
- [Release process](./guidelines/releases-guidelines) details
- [Decisions](./collaboration/sig-core/decisions) made by Kyma team members and the Core SIG.
- [Coding standards](./guidelines/technical-guidelines)

There are also [repository guidelines](./guidelines/repository-guidelines) for the Kyma team members. The guidelines contain a folder, file, and document structure required for a [skeleton Kyma repository](./guidelines/repository-guidelines/repository-template).

## Security

The community is relentless about Kyma security. To report a security issue, send an email with details directly to [kyma-security@googlegroups.com](mailto:kyma-security@googlegroups.com) instead of using a public issue tracker.
